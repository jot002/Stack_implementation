# Stack_implementation

I created an Integer Stack and a String Stack using arrays. To test my implementation, I 
created TextEditor and WeatherMonitor. TextEditor is created to replicate a text editor 
where a string is changed using delete, insert, and caseConvert. TextEditor will change
the string and update it while keeping a history log. WeatherMonitor is created to keep 
track of daily temperatures and see how many consecutive days the current temperature
is hotter than the other days.
